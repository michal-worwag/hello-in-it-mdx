# Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`

## Answer

When including JavaScript in an HTML document, the behavior of how the script is loaded and executed can vary depending on the attributes used in the `<script>` tag. Below are the differences:

1. `<script>` (default behavior):

- The script is loaded synchronously and executed immediately.
- It blocks the HTML parsing while it is being fetched and executed.
- If there are multiple scripts, they are executed in the order they appear in the document.

**Use case:** When the script depends on the HTML or other scripts that must run in a specific order.

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

2. `<script async>`:

- The script is loaded asynchronously, meaning it is fetched in parallel with HTML parsing.
- Once the script is downloaded, it is executed immediately, which may interrupt HTML parsing.
- Scripts with the async attribute do not guarantee execution order; they are executed as soon as they are ready.

**Use case**: For scripts that are independent of other scripts or the page content, such as third-party analytics or ads.

```html
<script async src="script.js"></script>
```

3. `<script defer>`:

- The script is fetched asynchronously (like async), but its execution is deferred until after the HTML parsing is complete.
- Deferred scripts maintain their order of execution as they appear in the document.
- Scripts with defer will not block HTML rendering.

**Use case**: When scripts need to wait for the full DOM to be parsed but must still execute in order.

```html
<script defer src="script.js"></script>
```

### Key Notes:

- Use `async` for independent scripts (e.g., analytics) where order doesn't matter.
- Use `defer` for scripts that rely on the DOM and need to execute after parsing.
- Avoid default `<script>` for performance-critical web pages, as it blocks rendering.

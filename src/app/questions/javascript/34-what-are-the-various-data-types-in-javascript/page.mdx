# What are the various data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has a variety of data types that are categorized into two groups: **primitive** and **non-primitive (complex)** types.

---

## **Primitive Data Types**

These data types are immutable and stored by value.

1. **Number**
   Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

   ```javascript
   let age = 30;
   let price = 19.99;
   ```

2. **String**
   Represents a sequence of characters.

   ```javascript
   let name = 'Alice';
   ```

3. **Boolean**
   Represents a logical value: `true` or `false`.

   ```javascript
   let isValid = true;
   ```

4. **Undefined**
   A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

   ```javascript
   let x;
   console.log(x); // undefined
   ```

5. **Null**
   Represents an explicitly empty or non-existent value.

   ```javascript
   let y = null;
   ```

6. **BigInt** (ES2020)
   Represents integers with arbitrary precision.

   ```javascript
   let largeNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
   ```

7. **Symbol** (ES2015)
   Represents a unique and immutable identifier.
   ```javascript
   let sym = Symbol('unique');
   ```

---

## **Non-Primitive (Complex) Data Types**

These are mutable and stored by reference.

1. **Object**
   Used to store collections of key-value pairs or more complex entities.

   ```javascript
   let person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
   ```

2. **Array** (a special type of Object)
   Represents an ordered list of values.

   ```javascript
   let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
   ```

3. **Function** (a callable Object)
   Represents executable code.

   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     return 'Hello!';
   }
   ```

4. **Date** (built-in Object)
   Represents dates and times.

   ```javascript
   let now = new Date();
   ```

5. **Other Built-in Objects**
   Examples include `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, and `WeakSet` for specialized data structures.

---

## **Dynamic Typing**

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold any data type and change type at runtime.

```javascript
let data = 42; // Number
data = 'Hello'; // Now a String
```

---

## **Conclusion**

Understanding JavaScript's data types is essential for writing robust and bug-free code. Knowing their characteristics, such as mutability and storage, helps developers manage memory and avoid common pitfalls.

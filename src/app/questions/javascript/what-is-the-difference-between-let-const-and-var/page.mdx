# What is the difference between let, const, and var?

## Answer:

**1. Scope:**

- `var` is function-scoped.
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are defined.

**2. Redeclaration:**

- `var` allows redeclaration of the same variable in the same scope.
- `let` and `const` do not allow redeclaration in the same scope.

**3. Reassignment:**

- `var` and `let` allow reassignment.
- `const` does not allow reassignment after initialization.

**4. Hoisting:**

- `var` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted but remain uninitialized until their declaration is encountered. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

### Examples

**`var` example**

```javascript
function exampleVar() {
  var x = 10;
  if (true) {
    var x = 20; // Same variable, re-declared
    console.log(x); // 20
  }
  console.log(x); // 20
}
exampleVar();
```

**`let` example**

```javascript
function exampleLet() {
  let x = 10;
  if (true) {
    let x = 20; // Different variable due to block scope
    console.log(x); // 20
  }
  console.log(x); // 10
}
exampleLet();
```

**`const` example**

```javascript
function exampleConst() {
  const x = 10;
  // x = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
  console.log(x); // 10
}
exampleConst();
```

### Key Points

- Use let for variables that will be reassigned later.
- Use const for variables that should not change.
- Avoid var in modern JavaScript development due to its function-scoping and hoisting behavior.

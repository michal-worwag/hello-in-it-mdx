# Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?

Extending built-in JavaScript objects (e.g., `Array`, `Object`, `String`) by adding custom methods or properties may seem convenient, but it comes with several significant risks and downsides.

---

## **Reasons to Avoid Extending Built-in Objects**

### 1. **Risk of Naming Collisions**

Adding properties or methods to built-in objects can clash with future updates to the JavaScript language or third-party libraries. If the same name is used for a built-in method in a future specification, your code could break.

```javascript
Array.prototype.myCustomMethod = function () {
  return 'Hello!';
};

// If future versions of JavaScript introduce `myCustomMethod`, this will cause conflicts.
```

### 2. **Affects Global Scope**

Changes to built-in objects affect all instances globally, which can lead to unintended side effects in unrelated code or libraries.

```javascript
String.prototype.reverse = function () {
  return this.split('').reverse().join('');
};

console.log('abc'.reverse()); // Works here

// Another library may rely on `String.prototype.reverse` and now behave unexpectedly.
```

### 3. **Performance Overhead**

Extending built-in objects can slow down JavaScript engines, as they need to handle additional properties on every instance of the object.

### 4. **Violates the Principle of Least Astonishment**

Developers expect built-in objects to behave in standard ways. Adding custom methods or properties can lead to confusion and bugs.

```javascript
Array.prototype.sum = function () {
  return this.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.sum()); // Works

// Another developer may not expect this and assume `sum` is a built-in method.
```

### 5. **Harder to Maintain Code**

Custom extensions make it harder for others (or even yourself) to understand and maintain the codebase. Developers unfamiliar with the extensions may struggle to debug issues.

### 6. **Compatibility Issues**

Third-party libraries may inadvertently rely on the original behavior of the built-in object, and your extensions can interfere with their functionality.

---

## **Recommended Alternatives**

### 1. **Utility Functions**

Instead of extending built-in objects, create standalone utility functions.

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(reverseString('abc')); // "cba"
```

### 2. **Subclasses**

If you need to add functionality, create a custom class that extends the built-in object.

```javascript
class CustomArray extends Array {
  sum() {
    return this.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
  }
}

const arr = new CustomArray(1, 2, 3);
console.log(arr.sum()); // 6
```

### 3. **Polyfills (with Caution)**

If you must add a feature that is widely missing in older environments, use a polyfill, but only if the feature is standardized.

```javascript
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function (element) {
    return this.indexOf(element) !== -1;
  };
}
```

## **When Extending Built-in Objects Might Be Acceptable**

1. **Private Use in a Controlled Environment**:

   - If you control the entire codebase and no external libraries are used.

2. **Standardized Polyfills**:
   - Adding features that conform to an official specification to support older environments.

---

## **Conclusion**

While it is technically possible to extend built-in JavaScript objects, it is generally considered bad practice due to potential naming collisions, global scope impacts, and maintainability challenges. Instead, use utility functions, subclasses, or polyfills as safer alternatives.

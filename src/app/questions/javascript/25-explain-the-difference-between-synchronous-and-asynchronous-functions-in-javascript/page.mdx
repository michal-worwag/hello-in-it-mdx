# Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions in JavaScript

## Answer

JavaScript functions can operate in either **synchronous** or **asynchronous** modes, depending on how they execute and handle tasks.

---

### **Synchronous Functions**

**Definition**
Synchronous functions execute **one at a time**, in the order they appear. The program waits for a function to complete before moving to the next one.

**Characteristics**

- Blocking: Each operation blocks the execution of subsequent code until it finishes.
- Easier to write and debug for simple tasks.

**Example**

```javascript
console.log('Start');
console.log('Middle');
console.log('End');
```

**Output**:

```
Start
Middle
End
```

In the above example, each `console.log` runs sequentially.

---

### **Asynchronous Functions**

**Definition**
Asynchronous functions allow tasks to run **independently** of the main thread. The program does not wait for the task to complete and continues execution.

**Characteristics**

- Non-blocking: Allows other operations to run while waiting for the task to complete.
- Typically used for I/O operations, network requests, or timers.
- Commonly implemented using callbacks, Promises, or `async/await`.

  **Example**

```javascript
console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Middle');
}, 1000);
console.log('End');
```

**Output**:

```
Start
End
Middle
```

Here, the `setTimeout` function executes asynchronously, allowing the program to continue running without waiting for the timer to finish.

### **When to Use**

**Synchronous Functions**

- For simple, predictable operations like mathematical calculations or string manipulations.

**Asynchronous Functions**

- For operations involving delays, like fetching data from a server, reading files, or timers.

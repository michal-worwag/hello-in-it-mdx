# What is the difference between a JavaScript variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared?

## Answer

In JavaScript, `null`, `undefined`, and undeclared variables represent different concepts of "no value" or "missing value." Understanding their differences is crucial to avoiding errors and writing cleaner code.

1. `null`

- **Definition**: null is an explicit value that represents the intentional absence of any object or value.
- **Type**: It is a primitive value but, due to a historical bug in JavaScript, typeof null returns "object".
- **Usage**: It is explicitly assigned by developers to indicate that a variable or object property does not currently have a value but is intended to have one later.

**Example**:

```javascript
let a = null; // a is explicitly set to "no value"
console.log(a); // null
console.log(typeof a); // "object"
```

2. `undefined`

- **Definition**: `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet.
- **Type**: It is a primitive value, and `typeof undefined` returns `"undefined"`.
- **Usage**:
  - Automatically assigned to uninitialized variables.
  - A function returns `undefined` if it does not have a return statement.
  - Accessing an object property or array element that does not exist returns `undefined`.

**Example**:

```javascript
let b; // b is declared but not initialized
console.log(b); // undefined
console.log(typeof b); // "undefined"

let obj = {};
console.log(obj.value); // undefined (property does not exist)

function noReturn() {}
console.log(noReturn()); // undefined
```

3. **Undeclared**

- **Definition**: An undeclared variable is one that has not been declared in the current scope. Attempting to use it will result in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Behavior**: Unlike `null` and `undefined`, undeclared variables are not part of the execution context.
- **Usage**: This usually happens when trying to use a variable without declaring it using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
  Example:

```javascript
console.log(c); // ReferenceError: c is not defined
```

**Note**: If you accidentally assign a value to an undeclared variable (without `strict mode`), JavaScript creates it as a global variable.

```javascript
Skopiuj kod
"use strict";
x = 5; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

### Key Notes

- `null` is intentional, `undefined` is unintentional, and undeclared is an outright error.
- Always declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var` to avoid undeclared errors.
- Use `null` when you want to explicitly clear a value.
- Avoid comparing values directly with `==` since it performs type coercion. Use `===` for strict equality checks.

```javascript
console.log(null == undefined); // true (type coercion)
console.log(null === undefined); // false (strict check)
```

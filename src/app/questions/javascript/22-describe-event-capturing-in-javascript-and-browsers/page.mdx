# Describe event capturing in JavaScript and browsers

## Answer

**Event capturing** (also known as "capture phase") in JavaScript is a mechanism where an event propagates from the root of the DOM (e.g., `document`) downward through its ancestors to the target element before the target processes the event.

### How Event Capturing Works

1. When an event occurs, it first propagates from the outermost ancestor (e.g., document) down the DOM tree towards the target element.
2. Each ancestor element along the way can listen to the event in the capture phase before it reaches the target.

**Example of Event Capturing**

```html
<div id="grandparent">
  <div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</div>
<script>
  document.getElementById('grandparent').addEventListener(
    'click',
    () => {
      console.log('Grandparent capturing!');
    },
    true // Enable capturing phase
  );

  document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener(
    'click',
    () => {
      console.log('Parent capturing!');
    },
    true // Enable capturing phase
  );

  document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Child clicked!');
  });
</script>
```

**Output on Button Click**:

```
Grandparent capturing!
Parent capturing!
Child clicked!
```

- The event starts at the grandparent in the capture phase, then moves to parent, and finally reaches the child (target phase).

### Enabling Event Capturing

By default, event listeners use the bubbling phase. To listen during the capture phase, set the third parameter of `addEventListener` to `true`.

```javascript
element.addEventListener('event', callback, true);
```

### Use Cases for Event Capturing

1. Specialized Event Handling:

   - Useful when you need to handle events before they reach the target.

2. Overriding Event Behavior:

   - Allows handling events at an earlier stage, such as preventing default actions or stopping propagation.

3. Complex Hierarchical DOM:

   - Ensures certain elements get the event first, regardless of bubbling behavior.

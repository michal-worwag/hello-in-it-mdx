# What is the difference between mouseenter and mouseover event in JavaScript and browsers?

## Answer

The difference between the `mouseenter` and `mouseover` events in JavaScript lies in how they handle event propagation and triggering when interacting with child elements:

### 1. `mouseover` Event

    - Triggered when the mouse pointer enters the bound element or any of its child elements.
    - Bubbles: Yes, propagates up through the DOM hierarchy.

**Example**:

```javascript
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
  console.log('Mouse over parent!');
});
```

**Behavior**: If the mouse moves over child elements inside `parent`, the event is still triggered for `parent`.

### 2. `mouseenter` Event

    - Triggered only when the mouse pointer enters the bound element itself, not its child elements.
    - Does not bubble: This event does not propagate up through the DOM hierarchy.

**Example**:

```javascript
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
  console.log('Mouse entered parent!');
});
```

**Behavior**: If the mouse moves over child elements inside parent, the event is not triggered again for parent.

### Practical Use Cases

1.  `mouseover`:

        - Useful for interactions involving both the element and its child elements.
            Example: Highlight a menu when hovering over it or its sub-items.

2.  `mouseenter`:

        - Useful for handling hover logic only for the specific element itself.
            Example: Display a tooltip when hovering over an element but not its children.

### Example Comparing Behavior

```html
Skopiuj kod

<div id="parent" style="padding: 20px; background: lightblue;">
  Parent
  <div id="child" style="margin: 10px; background: lightcoral;">Child</div>
</div>
<script>
  document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    console.log('Mouse over parent!');
  });

  document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
    console.log('Mouse entered parent!');
  });
</script>
```

- Hovering over the child triggers the mouseover for parent but not the mouseenter.

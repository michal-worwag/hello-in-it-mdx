# What is the event loop in JavaScript runtimes?

## Answer:

The event loop is a fundamental mechanism in JavaScript that enables non-blocking, asynchronous programming by managing the execution of multiple tasks, including those initiated by events, timers, or external resources like APIs.

### How the Event Loop Works:

1. Call Stack:

- A stack where function calls are added when invoked and removed when execution completes.
- Example:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello');
}
sayHello(); // Function added to the stack, executed, then removed.
```

2. Web APIs/Background Tasks:

- When asynchronous operations (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`) are initiated, they are sent to the browser or Node.js environment to be handled externally.

3. Task Queue/Callback Queue:

- Once an asynchronous task completes, its callback is added to the task queue.

4. Microtask Queue:

- Contains tasks from `Promise` callbacks or `MutationObserver`.
- These are given priority over the regular task queue.

5. Event Loop:

- Continuously monitors the call stack and task queues.
- If the call stack is empty, it pushes tasks from the microtask queue first, then from the task queue.

**Visual Example**:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timer finished');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise resolved');
});

console.log('End');
```

**Output**:

```sql
Start
End
Promise resolved
Timer finished
```

**Explanation**:

- `console.log('Start')` and `console.log('End')` are synchronous and run immediately.
- The `Promise` callback (microtask) runs before the `setTimeout` callback (macrotask) because microtasks have higher priority.

### Key Points:

- JavaScript is single-threaded but achieves concurrency via the event loop.
- Microtasks (e.g., promises) are handled before macrotasks (e.g., timers).

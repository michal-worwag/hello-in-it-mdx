# How does JavaScript garbage collection work?

JavaScript's garbage collection is an automatic process that manages memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable or needed in the application.

---

## **Key Concepts**

### 1. **Memory Allocation**

When you create objects, variables, or functions, memory is allocated to store these values.

```javascript
let obj = { key: 'value' }; // Memory is allocated for 'obj'
```

### 2. **Reachability**

An object is considered "reachable" if it is:

- Referenced by a root (e.g., `window`, `global`).
- Accessible via references from other reachable objects.

### 3. **Garbage Collection Process**

The garbage collector identifies and removes objects that are no longer reachable. The primary algorithm used is:

#### **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**

1. Start with root objects (e.g., global variables, the call stack).
2. Mark all reachable objects.
3. Sweep and reclaim memory for unmarked (unreachable) objects.

```javascript
let obj = { key: 'value' };
obj = null; // The object is now unreachable and will be collected.
```

## **Common Triggers for Garbage Collection**

1. **Setting Variables to `null` or `undefined`:** Explicitly removing references.
   ```javascript
   let data = { key: 'value' };
   data = null; // Helps garbage collector reclaim memory.
   ```
2. **Out-of-Scope Variables:** Variables in local functions are collected when the function exits.
   ```javascript
   function example() {
     let temp = 'data';
   } // 'temp' is no longer reachable after the function ends.
   ```

## **Best Practices to Help Garbage Collection**

1. **Avoid Memory Leaks:**

   - Unintended references can prevent garbage collection.
   - Example: Adding listeners without removing them.

   ```javascript
   let element = document.getElementById('button');
   element.addEventListener('click', () => {
     console.log('Clicked!');
   });

   // If 'element' is not set to null, it may stay in memory.
   element = null; // Explicitly remove reference.
   ```

2. **Use WeakMaps and WeakSets:**
   These structures allow objects to be garbage-collected if no other references exist.

   ```javascript
   let weakMap = new WeakMap();
   let obj = {};
   weakMap.set(obj, 'value');
   obj = null; // Object can be garbage-collected.
   ```

## **Conclusion**

JavaScript's garbage collection ensures efficient memory management by reclaiming unused objects. While it works automatically, following best practices like managing references and avoiding memory leaks can improve performance and reliability.

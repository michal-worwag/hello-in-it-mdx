# Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage in browsers

## Answer:

Cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage are all used for storing data in a user's browser, but they differ in scope, storage size, and how they are managed.

### Cookies

1. Purpose: Primarily used for storing data that needs to be sent back to the server with every HTTP request (e.g., session identifiers, user preferences).
2. Storage Limit: Typically 4 KB per cookie.
3. Scope:

- Accessible both by JavaScript (if not marked HttpOnly) and server.
- Can have expiration dates for persistence.

**Example:**

```javascript
document.cookie =
  'username=JohnDoe; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT; path=/';
```

4. Cons:

- Small storage limit.
- Automatically sent with every HTTP request, increasing bandwidth usage.

### localStorage

1. Purpose: Stores data with no expiration, useful for persisting data across sessions.
2. Storage Limit: Approximately 5–10 MB per domain.
3. Scope:

- Data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- Accessible only by JavaScript on the same domain.

**Example:**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
console.log(localStorage.getItem('username')); // "JohnDoe"
```

4. Cons:

- Not suitable for sensitive data as it's accessible via JavaScript.

### sessionStorage

1. Purpose: Stores data for the duration of a page session.
2. Storage Limit: Approximately 5–10 MB per domain.
3. Scope:

- Data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
- Accessible only by JavaScript on the same domain.

**Example:**

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('username')); // "JohnDoe"
```

4. Cons:

- Data is lost when the session ends.

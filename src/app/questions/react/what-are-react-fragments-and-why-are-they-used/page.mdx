# What are React Fragments, and why are they used?

## Answer

React Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. They help avoid unnecessary wrappers, keeping the DOM clean.

**Syntax:**

```
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>This is a React fragment example.</p>
    </>
  );
}

```

**Alternatively:**

```
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>This is a React fragment example.</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

Fragments improve performance by reducing the DOM tree size.

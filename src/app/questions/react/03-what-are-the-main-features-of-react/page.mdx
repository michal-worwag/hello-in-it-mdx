# What are the main features of React?

## Answer

React has several core features:

- Declarative UI: React uses a declarative programming style, making it easy to describe how the UI should look based on the application state.
- Component-Based Architecture: The UI is built as reusable components, which manage their own state and logic.
- Virtual DOM: React uses a lightweight copy of the DOM to optimize UI updates, ensuring efficient rendering.
- One-Way Data Binding: Data flows in a unidirectional manner, making debugging and state management easier.
- JSX Syntax: React uses JSX, an HTML-like syntax, for creating elements, which is transpiled to JavaScript.

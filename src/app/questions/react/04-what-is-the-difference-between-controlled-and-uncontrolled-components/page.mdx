# What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

## Answer

**1. Controlled Components:**

- React manages the state of the form element.
- The value of the input is set via state, and changes are handled with an onChange handler.

```
const [value, setValue] = useState("");
return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
```

**2. Uncontrolled Components:**

- The DOM directly manages the state of the form element.
- Access the value using a ref.

```
const inputRef = useRef(null);
return <input ref={inputRef} />;
```

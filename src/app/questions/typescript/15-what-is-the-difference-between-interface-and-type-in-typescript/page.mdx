# What is the Difference Between "interface" and "type" in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, both interface and type can define object shapes, but they have key differences:

- Declaration Merging: Interfaces support declaration merging, allowing multiple declarations to be combined. Types do not support this feature.

- Extensibility: Interfaces can extend other interfaces or type aliases using the extends keyword. Types can create new types by combining existing ones using intersection (&) and union (|) operators.

- Primitives and Unions: Type aliases can represent primitive values, union types, and tuples, which interfaces cannot.

In summary, use interfaces for defining object shapes and when declaration merging is beneficial. Use type aliases for primitives, unions, and when needing advanced type compositions.

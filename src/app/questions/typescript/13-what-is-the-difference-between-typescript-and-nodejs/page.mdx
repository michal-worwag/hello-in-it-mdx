# What is the Difference Between TypeScript and Node.js?

TypeScript is a programming language that adds static typing and advanced features to JavaScript, enhancing code quality.

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.

TypeScript is used for writing code, while Node.js executes it, often used together for server-side applications.

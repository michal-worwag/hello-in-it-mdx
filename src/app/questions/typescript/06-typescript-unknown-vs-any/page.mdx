# What is the purpose of the unknown type? How is it different from any?

## Answer

The `unknown` type is a safer alternative to `any`. It represents any value but requires type-checking before performing operations on it.

```
let value: unknown;

value = "Hello";
if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe operation
}

// let num: number = value; // Error without type-checking
```

**Difference from `any`:**

- `any` allows any operation, which may lead to runtime errors.
- `unknown` forces type checks, improving type safety.

# What is the Difference Between "null" and "undefined" in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` both represent the absence of a value but differ in their usage and implications:

- `null`: Denotes the intentional absence of any object value. It's explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it currently holds no value.
- `undefined`: Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It's the default value for uninitialized variables.

The behavior of these types is influenced by the `strictNullChecks` compiler option:

- With `strictNullChecks` disabled: Both `null` and `undefined` are considered assignable to any type, which can lead to unexpected errors.
- With `strictNullChecks` enabled: `null` and `undefined` are only assignable to their respective types (and `any`), enhancing type safety by preventing unintended assignments.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective type management and avoiding common pitfalls in TypeScript development.

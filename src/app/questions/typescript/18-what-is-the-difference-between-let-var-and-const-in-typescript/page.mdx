# What is the Difference Between "let," "var," and "const" in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, each with distinct behaviors regarding scope, hoisting, and mutability:

1. `var`:

- Scope: Function-scoped; accessible throughout the function in which it's declared.
- Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined, allowing access before declaration without causing errors.
- Re-declaration: Permits re-declaration within the same scope, which can lead to unintended overwrites.

2. `let`:

- Scope: Block-scoped; confined to the block ({}) in which it's declared, enhancing control over variable accessibility.
- Hoisting: Variables declared with let are hoisted but not initialized, resulting in a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration.
- Re-declaration: Does not allow re-declaration within the same scope, preventing accidental overwrites.

3. `const`:

- Scope: Block-scoped, similar to let.
- Hoisting: Behaves like let in terms of hoisting; accessing before declaration throws a ReferenceError.
- Mutability: Requires an initializer and prevents re-assignment, ensuring the variable remains constant.

Understanding these differences is crucial for writing predictable and maintainable TypeScript code.
